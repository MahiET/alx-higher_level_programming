# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

What is JavaScript?
=

 JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).

JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more

JavaScript data types and data structures
=

Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but these often differfrom one language to another. This article attempts to list the built-in data structures available in JavaScript and what properties they have. These can be used to build other data structures. Wherever possible, comparisons with other languages are drawn.


Primitive values
=
All types except objects define immutable values (that is, values which can't be changed). For example (and unlike in C), Strings are immutable. We refer to values of these types as "primitive values".

Boolean type

Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two values: true and false. See Boolean and Boolean for more details.

Null type

The Null type has exactly one value: null. See null and Null for more details.

Undefined type

A variable that has not been assigned a value has the value undefined. See undefined and Undefined for more details.

Number type

The Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value (numbers between -(2^53 − 1) and 2^53 − 1). In addition to representing floating-point numbers, the number type has three symbolic values: +Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN ("Not a Number").
